## Trading Agent: Web Search & Data Extraction

### Overview

This project implements an intelligent Trading Agent that utilizes a web search tool to retrieve real-time market data based on user prompts. For example, when you ask, "What is the trade price of TSLA?", the agent will automatically search the web (via DuckDuckGo) and return the price in a tabular format.

Built with the Phidata (now Agno) framework, the agent integrates multiple tools for real-time data retrieval and processing, using Groq for LLM API integration and OpenAI for advanced language model capabilities.

### Features

• Web-based Search: Utilizes DuckDuckGo to fetch trading-related information from the web based on user queries.

• Real-Time Data Retrieval: Retrieves and processes stock data dynamically using LLM-driven reasoning.

• Tabular Output: Provides the results in a user-friendly tabular format for easy analysis and decision-making.

• Extensible: Built on top of the Phidata (Agno) framework, making it easy to extend with additional tools or improve the search and extraction processes.

### Technologies Used

• Phidata (Agno): A cutting-edge agentic AI framework for building intelligent agents with powerful tools.

• Groq: Utilized for LLM API processing and efficient computation.

• OpenAI API: Incorporated for advanced natural language processing and reasoning capabilities.

• DuckDuckGo: A privacy-focused search engine used to query real-time market data and stock prices.

• Python: Core programming language used to orchestrate the system.
